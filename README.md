What is it for?

Compare the images folder and another folder, if there are matches in the name, it copies the images to another folder, the files that have no matches create a txt to indicate which ones they are.

Ideal to know which roms you have left to scrape

How does it work?

Select the images folder
Select the roms folder
Select the output folder
Select the process matches button
